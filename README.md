<h1>Introduction</h1>
This code was created for DD2421 Machine Learning course at the KTH for the programming challenge.
The goal of this project was to create a classifier using any methods and sources available to classify real-world resembling data.
<h1>System Description</h1>
This project utilises AdaBoost classifier with data cleaning. The trees are limited in width and the principal component analysis is performed before fitting the model, other parameters are found by analysis of cross validation in a separate jupyter notebook.
<h1>Results</h1>
The model was over 85% accurate when compared with the ground truth of the data to classify.
